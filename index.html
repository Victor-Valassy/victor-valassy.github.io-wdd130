                <p>Hello. My name is Oluwasegun. I'm a 24yr old African born and bred in Nigeria, I'm a proffessional visual artist, beverage specialist, also an aspiring IT specialist, currently studying Software and web development at BYU-I(Brigham Young University-Idaho). My birthday is on April 27th, and I always hangout with friends and family at the beach. My hobbies are, singing, painting, listening to music, reading, and sports, mainly football, basket-ball, swimming and table-tennis.I love Exploring various careers, it helps broaden my mental horizon, and in some cases, creates opportunities to network with professionals which also makes me grow as a person, and most importantly as a christian I get to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
